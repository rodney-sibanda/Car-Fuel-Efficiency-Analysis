# Car Fuel Efficiency Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between various vehicle attributes and fuel efficiency, specifically miles per gallon (MPG). The analysis uses the MPG dataset from the ggplot2 package, which includes data on car characteristics such as engine displacement, cylinder count, drive type, and fuel efficiency. The goal of the project is to build a multi-linear regression model to quantify how these attributes influence fuel efficiency and to explore trade-offs between vehicle performance and fuel consumption.

Key steps in the methodology include cleaning and preparing the dataset, selecting significant predictors, and building a regression model. The project aims to provide insights into which vehicle features most significantly affect fuel efficiency and how consumers can balance performance with sustainability. This project not only offers a predictive model for fuel efficiency but also examines the impact of factors like engine size, vehicle class, and drivetrain type, helping consumers make more informed vehicle choices
